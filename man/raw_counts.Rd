\description{
A subset of TCGA-LUAD RNA-seq gene-level counts generated by STAR and distributed via UCSC Xena.
Data originate from GDC, only selected samples are included.
Gene identifiers are Ensembl IDs with the version suffix removed (e.g., "ENSG00000141510.15" → "ENSG00000141510").
Sample barcodes were compacted and written with dots instead of dashes (e.g., "TCGA-38-4627-11A" → "TCGA.38.4627.11A").
